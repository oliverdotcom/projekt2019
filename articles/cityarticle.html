            Well, as any sane person would, you could just look up the definition on Wikipedia. Fear not, we’ve already got it covered, but prepare yourself, it’s long and boring, and if you want you can just skip to the next paragraph: “A green/sustainable city is a city designed with consideration for social, economic, environmental impact and resilient habitat for existing populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same.”
            <br><br>
            While this sounds nice and sciency, you and I both know, that neither of us really understands what this means in practice. The thing is though, sustainability is on everyones lips these days. So whether you’re genuinely interested in learning about green cities, or just want to impress that hippie chick you like, you’ve come to the right place.

            <span class="subheading">Colorful trashcans and silent busses</span><br><br><br>
            Green cities and living sustainably aren’t exactly new concepts. People have always lived in harmony with nature, and even though the industrial revolution might have put a dent in that concept, we’ve still been aware of sustainability, at least to some degree.

            But during the last couple of years, you might have noticed some changes around your city. Colorful trashcans appearing everywhere, telling you where to put what. Big, green busses that somehow don’t make any noise. Bikepaths taking up more space than the road. It’s almost 2020, and instead of flying cars and lightsabers, we’ve gotten rainwater tanks and organic vegetables. Where did we go wrong?
            <br><br>
            Well, even though all of this might seem boring, it's a great step in the right direction. And you might as well learn a bit about it.
            <br><br>
            Here are 3 things, that your city has probably already done, to lessen its carbon footprint:
            <br><br>
            <span class="subheading">1. Waste Sorting</span>
            <br><br>
            Yes, those colored trashcans around your city might not be the prettiest sight, but they make sure that things get recycled. I must admit, in the beginning i didn't fancy the idea of a trashcan telling me what to do.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="subheading">2. Electric transportation</span>
            <br><br>
            In Aarhus we have had the "Letbane" for a couple of years now. It is an electric tram that carries a bunch of people, and works 75% of the time. Not only is it better for the environment than busses, it's also way more comfortable. If you have something similar in your city, I suggest you try it out.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="subheading">3. Green areas</span>
            <br><br>
            This one might seem obvious. But hey, sometimes you have to highlight the things that are right there in front of you. Parks and other green areas have always been a part of cities, but more and more are being built. The plants help clean the air, and people have the oppurtunity to appreciate nature, without going too far away from civilization.
