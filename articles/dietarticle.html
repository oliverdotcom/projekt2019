            Research the many health benefits of eating less meat and more plants. Maybe you don't really care about the planet, but you definitely care about looking good naked.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="subheading">2.</span><br><br>
            Take your time. If you love your steaks, meatballs and greasy bacon, you're probably not going to go plant-based overnight. Maybe just start by getting rid of the bacon.
            <br><br><br><span class="subheading">3.</span><br><br>
            Make sure to get the same amount of calories. A lot of the people who try to cut out meat, fail to realize that you need to eat way more plants, to feel as full as you're used to. This is something that you will quickly adjust to, but it can be hard in the beginning.
            <br><br><br><span class="subheading">4.</span><br><br>
            If you're not keen on completely dropping the meat, start using it as the side dish. Most people consider meat the main part of their meal, and the plants the supplement. Try viewing it the other way around.
            <br><br><br><span class="subheading">5.</span><br><br>
            Have fun with it. This is your chance to get creative, and out of your comfort zone. You have probably eaten the same 10 dishes your entire life. Google away, and try something new and exciting.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="subheading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck on your adventure!</span>
